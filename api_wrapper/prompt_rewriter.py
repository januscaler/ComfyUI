"""MiMo-backed prompt rewriting for the MiniMax H3 endpoints.

MiniMax H3 does not want a one-line description; it wants a structured prompt
with an alignment instruction, ``integrated_multimodal_description`` broken
into timed shots, ``overall_soundscape`` and ``non_diegetic_music`` (or, in
reference mode, six sections keyed by ``<Picture i>`` / ``<Video k>`` /
``<Audio j>`` labels). Writing one by hand is most of the work of using the
model at all.

This module puts an LLM in front of that: it hands Xiaomi's MiMo v2.5 MiniMax's
own H3 prompt-writing guide (vendored under ``h3_prompt_skill/``) plus the
concrete parameters of the job about to run -- mode, duration, canvas, which
reference labels exist -- and asks for the finished H3 prompt. Callers who
already have one send ``raw_prompt`` instead and skip all of this.

The endpoint is OpenAI chat-completions compatible, so ``MIMO_BASE_URL`` can
point at a third-party host of the same model instead of Xiaomi's.

- Use only the reference labels listed as available. Never invent a label for
  content the caller did not supply, and never leave a label unresolved.
- Every shot timestamp must fall inside the target duration, and the described
  action must fill that duration -- do not write a 15-second scene for a 5-second
  video.
- Keep dialogue, lyrics and on-screen text in their original language and
  wording; write everything else in English.
- Prefer concrete visual and audio detail over adjectives like "cinematic" or
